# ABAP Program: ZD17_EX17

This repository contains the ABAP program `ZD17_EX17`, which demonstrates basic ABAP syntax, including data declaration, parameter handling, and output formatting.

## ðŸ“˜ Program Overview
This program collects user input for a department name and a name, then displays this information along with a predefined age and the current date. It serves as an introductory exercise in ABAP programming, covering key concepts like data declaration, parameter handling, and the use of system variables.

## ðŸ›  Features
1. **Data Declaration**:  
   - Custom data types are defined for character strings, integers, and packed numbers.
   - Variables are declared using both elementary and custom data types.
   
2. **Parameter Input**:  
   - Accepts user input for department name (`pa_dept`) and name (`pa_name`) through PARAMETERS.

3. **System Variable Usage**:  
   - Demonstrates the use of `sy-datum` for retrieving the current date.

4. **Output Formatting**:  
   - Displays the input values and predefined variables using `WRITE` statements.

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives
- Understand the structure of an ABAP program.
- Learn how to declare and use custom data types.
- Practice collecting input using PARAMETERS.
- Familiarize yourself with system variables like `sy-datum`.
- Display data using formatted `WRITE` statements.

## ðŸš€ Next Steps
You can extend this program by:
- Adding validation for input parameters.
- Experimenting with additional data types.
- Formatting the output with advanced `WRITE` options.
